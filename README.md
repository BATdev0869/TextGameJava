First, when you download 'TextGame.Java', PUT IT IN THE DESKTOP! It will not work anywhere else. When you do, As a little help, I will provide a program called Compile&Run
so you don't have to type all of those **PESKY** commands. I made everything as open source as possible, and you can check it out. No Base64,
no suspicious encoding, not even a variable in sight! So, you can check everything, put it in VirusTotal, it works just fine. You can also use Compile&Run for future projects!
It is a fine tool that I created that can last for as long as your computer does! It doesn't specifically check for TextGame.java, it checks for EVERY java file in your desktop!
 You can also change it to be convient in your use case! For example, if a folder in your desktop is usually where it is, look nowhere else but that .bat file I crafted!
It works well for me, so it works well for you! Thanks!

-- FOR PHSYCOPATHS --
For you pesky physcopaths, I decided to add a section here for you.
Just type javac TextGame.Java, then java TextGame. Sure, it takes a bit longer, but it adds up over time. You're welcome!
